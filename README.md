# Personal Website

Welcome to the code that runs ben-hilger.com!

## File Structure

**web/** -> Stores the main NextJS project for [ben-hilger.com](https://ben-hilger.com)

Eventually, there will be other files that will store variants of the website using different languages and/or frameworks. This will be done as I learn new programming languages and want to experiment adding those into my personal website ecosystem.

## Running web

### Navigate to the web directory

```bash
cd web
```

### Make sure you install all of the required packages

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
